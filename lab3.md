# Lab 3
## Bugs
### Failure Inducing Input:
```
@Test
  public void averageMultLowest() {
    double[] input1 = {0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 0.0, 6.0, 0.0};
    assertEquals(2.0, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1), 0.001);
  }
```

### Non-Failure Inducing Input:
```
@Test
    public void testAverageWithoutLowest_NoFailure() {
        double[] arr = {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 6.0};
        assertEquals(2.0, averageWithoutLowest(arr), 0.001);
    }
```
### Symptom:
![Image](ArrayListExampleAvgFail.png)

### The Buggy Code:
```
static double averageWithoutLowest(double[] arr) {
    if(arr.length < 2) { return 0.0; }
    double lowest = arr[0];
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num < lowest) { lowest = num; }
    }
    double sum = 0;
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num != lowest) { sum += num; }
    }
    return sum / (arr.length - 1);
  }
```

### Fixed Code:
```
static double averageWithoutLowest(double[] arr) {
    if(arr.length < 2) { 
    return 0.0; 
    }
    double lowest = arr[0];
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num < lowest) {
      lowest = num; 
      }
    }
    int count = 0
    double sum = 0;
    for(double num: arr) {
      if(num != lowest) { 
      sum += num;
      count ++;
      }
    }
    return sum / count;
  }
```

In the corrected version, I added a count to keep track of the number of non-lowest numbers in the array (even if multiple are present). Instead of dividing by arr.length - 1, it divides by count to get the correct average.

## `Grep` Command

### `grep -n`

Displays the lines where the match is found and the number of those lines in their respective files, if called in more than one file. 
```
[ddw004@ieng6-201]:Media:438$ grep -n "9/11" Terrorist_Attack.txt
20:still making headlines, known as simply "9/11."

### `grep -B n`

Prints the line where the search is found along with n lines before the result. The same principle applies if multiple instances of the search are found.
